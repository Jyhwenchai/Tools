# App Icon Requirements

## Icon Design Specifications

### Concept
The app icon should represent a collection of utility tools, suggesting productivity and efficiency.

### Design Elements
- **Primary Symbol**: A toolbox or wrench icon
- **Color Scheme**: Modern blue gradient (#007AFF to #5856D6)
- **Style**: Clean, minimalist, following macOS design guidelines
- **Background**: Subtle gradient or solid color

### Required Sizes (macOS)
- 16x16 (1x and 2x)
- 32x32 (1x and 2x) 
- 128x128 (1x and 2x)
- 256x256 (1x and 2x)
- 512x512 (1x and 2x)

### Design Guidelines
1. **Simplicity**: Clean and recognizable at small sizes
2. **Consistency**: Matches macOS visual style
3. **Scalability**: Looks good at all required sizes
4. **Uniqueness**: Distinguishable from other utility apps

### Implementation Notes
- Icons should be created as PNG files with transparent backgrounds
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for macOS icons
- Test visibility at smallest sizes (16x16)
- Ensure icon works well in both light and dark menu bars

## Current Status
App icon placeholders are configured but actual icon files need to be created by a designer.
