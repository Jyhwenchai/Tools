# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A comprehensive color processing tool that enables users to work with colors in multiple formats, select colors interactively, and sample colors from the screen. This tool will support conversion between various color representations (RGB, Hex, HSLA, etc.), provide an intuitive color picker interface, and include screen color sampling functionality for design and development workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to convert colors between different formats (RGB, Hex, HSLA, CMYK, etc.), so that I can work with colors in the format required by different tools and platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a color value in any supported format THEN the system SHALL display the equivalent values in all other supported formats
2. WHEN a user modifies a color value in one format THEN the system SHALL automatically update all other format representations in real-time
3. WHEN a user enters an invalid color value THEN the system SHALL display clear validation feedback and highlight the error
4. WHEN a user copies a color value THEN the system SHALL copy the formatted color string to the clipboard with toast notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use an interactive color picker to select colors visually, so that I can choose precise colors without manually entering values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the color picker THEN the system SHALL display a native macOS color picker interface
2. WHEN a user selects a color from the picker THEN the system SHALL update all color format fields with the selected color values
3. WHEN a user adjusts color properties (hue, saturation, brightness, alpha) THEN the system SHALL provide real-time preview and update all formats
4. WHEN a user selects a color THEN the system SHALL display a color preview swatch showing the current selection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a UI designer, I want to sample colors directly from my screen, so that I can extract exact colors from existing designs or applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates screen color sampling THEN the system SHALL provide a screen sampling tool with crosshair cursor
2. WHEN a user clicks on any pixel on the screen THEN the system SHALL capture the exact color at that location
3. WHEN a color is sampled from screen THEN the system SHALL update all color format fields with the sampled color values
4. WHEN sampling is active THEN the system SHALL display real-time color preview under the cursor
5. WHEN a user presses ESC during sampling THEN the system SHALL cancel the sampling operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save and manage frequently used colors, so that I can quickly access my color palette for consistent design work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a color THEN the system SHALL add it to a persistent color palette
2. WHEN a user views saved colors THEN the system SHALL display them as clickable color swatches with format labels
3. WHEN a user clicks a saved color swatch THEN the system SHALL load that color into all format fields
4. WHEN a user deletes a saved color THEN the system SHALL remove it from the palette with confirmation
5. WHEN a user exports the palette THEN the system SHALL save colors to a file in a standard format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the color tool to integrate seamlessly with the existing app interface, so that it feels like a natural part of the toolkit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the color tool THEN the system SHALL display it using the consistent app design language
2. WHEN the app theme changes THEN the color tool SHALL adapt to light/dark mode appropriately
3. WHEN a user performs color operations THEN the system SHALL show toast notifications for successful actions
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages consistent with other tools
5. WHEN the tool loads THEN the system SHALL initialize quickly without blocking the UI

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an accessibility-conscious user, I want the color tool to be fully accessible, so that I can use it effectively with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide clear labels and descriptions for all color values and controls
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN the system SHALL support full keyboard navigation through all interface elements
3. WHEN color values change THEN the system SHALL announce the changes to screen readers
4. WHEN using high contrast mode THEN the system SHALL maintain clear visual distinction between interface elements
5. WHEN colors are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide alternative text descriptions of color values
