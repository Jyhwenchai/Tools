# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing time converter tool to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly time conversion experience. The enhanced tool will feature real-time current timestamp display, batch conversion capabilities, improved UI layout with tabbed interface, and enhanced timezone handling to match the functionality shown in the reference design.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see the current timestamp updating in real-time, so that I can quickly reference the current time without manual refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the time converter view loads THEN the system SHALL display the current Unix timestamp in real-time
2. WHEN the timestamp updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the display every second automatically
3. WHEN the user clicks "切换单位" THEN the system SHALL toggle between seconds and milliseconds display
4. WHEN the user clicks "复制" THEN the system SHALL copy the current timestamp to clipboard
5. WHEN the user clicks "停止" THEN the system SHALL pause the real-time timestamp updates
6. WHEN the user clicks "停止" again THEN the system SHALL resume the real-time timestamp updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between single conversion and batch conversion modes, so that I can handle different conversion scenarios efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the time converter THEN the system SHALL display two tabs: "单个转换" and "批量转换"
2. WHEN the user clicks "单个转换" tab THEN the system SHALL show the single conversion interface
3. WHEN the user clicks "批量转换" tab THEN the system SHALL show the batch conversion interface
4. WHEN in batch mode THEN the system SHALL allow multiple timestamp/date inputs
5. WHEN in batch mode THEN the system SHALL process all inputs simultaneously and display results in a list format

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert timestamps to readable dates with timezone selection, so that I can understand time values in different contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a timestamp THEN the system SHALL provide a timezone dropdown with common timezones
2. WHEN the user selects a timezone THEN the system SHALL convert the timestamp to the selected timezone
3. WHEN the user clicks "转换" THEN the system SHALL display the converted date in readable format
4. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL show the result in the "转换结果" field
5. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a copy button for the result

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert readable dates to timestamps with timezone awareness, so that I can get Unix timestamps from human-readable dates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters a date string THEN the system SHALL provide timezone selection for the input date
2. WHEN the user selects source timezone THEN the system SHALL interpret the date in that timezone
3. WHEN the user clicks "转换" THEN the system SHALL convert the date to Unix timestamp
4. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL display the timestamp result
5. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide unit selection (seconds/milliseconds)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved UI layout that matches modern design patterns, so that I can use the tool more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the time converter THEN the system SHALL display a clean, tabbed interface
2. WHEN displaying the current timestamp THEN the system SHALL show it prominently at the top with large, readable text
3. WHEN showing conversion sections THEN the system SHALL organize them in clear, separated cards
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback and copy functionality
5. WHEN the user interacts with controls THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced error handling and validation, so that I can understand and correct input errors easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enters invalid input THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight the problematic input field
3. WHEN timezone conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error information
4. WHEN batch conversion encounters errors THEN the system SHALL show which items failed and why
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN the system SHALL clear error states automatically

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features, so that I can use the tool efficiently with different input methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Cmd+C on a result THEN the system SHALL copy the result to clipboard
2. WHEN the user presses Enter in an input field THEN the system SHALL trigger conversion
3. WHEN the user navigates with Tab THEN the system SHALL follow logical tab order
4. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate accessibility labels
5. WHEN the user uses keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide visual focus indicators
