# Task Analysis 

## Pre-Implementation Analysis
- **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate implementation difficulty before starting new features
- **Library Research**: Use 'fetch' MCP to search GitHub for existing libraries that could implement the required functionality
- **Decision Framework**: If third-party libraries significantly simplify implementation, recommend manual addition; otherwise implement natively
- **Dependency Minimalism**: Maintain minimal dependencies to preserve performance and security
