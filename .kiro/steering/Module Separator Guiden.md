Analyze the modified Swift files to ensure:
1. Each feature module (Clipboard, Encryption, ImageProcessing, JSON, QRCode, TimeConverter, Settings) maintains logical separation with no cross-module dependencies
2. UI components remain within their respective feature modules unless they are truly generic and reusable (in which case they should be in Shared/Components)
3. Models, Services, and Views within each feature module only reference their own module's components or shared utilities
4. No direct imports or dependencies between different feature modules
5. Shared components are truly generic and not feature-specific

If violations are found, suggest refactoring to maintain proper module boundaries and architectural integrity.
