# Toast Timer and Queue Management Implementation

## Task 8: Implement timer and queue management

### Overview

Successfully implemented robust timer and queue management for the toast notification system with advanced state tracking, intelligent queuing, and comprehensive thread safety. This implementation provides sophisticated control over toast lifecycle, prevents spam, and ensures optimal user experience.

### Key Enhancements

#### 1. Robust Timer System

- **TimerState Structure**: Created a comprehensive timer state management system
  - Tracks timer, start time, original duration, pause state, and pause timestamp
  - Calculates remaining time accounting for paused duration
  - Handles timer lifecycle with proper cleanup

#### 2. Enhanced Timer Management

- **Pause/Resume Logic**: Implemented sophisticated hover pause/resume functionality
  - `pauseAutoDismiss()`: Pauses timer and records pause time
  - `resumeAutoDismiss()`: Resumes with accurate remaining time calculation
  - Handles edge cases like expired timers during pause
  - Thread-safe operations using serial dispatch queue

#### 3. Queue Management System

- **Simultaneous Toast Limits**: Maximum of 5 toasts displayed at once
- **Queue Processing**: Automatic processing of queued toasts when space becomes available
- **Processing Interval**: 0.1 second interval to prevent spam
- **Batch Operations**: Support for batch toast display with `showBatch()` method

#### 4. Thread Safety

- **Serial Queue**: All operations use a dedicated serial dispatch queue
- **Main Thread Updates**: UI updates properly dispatched to main thread
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Proper synchronization of timer operations

#### 5. Memory Management

- **Proper Cleanup**: Enhanced deinit with comprehensive timer cleanup
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of queue processing timer
- **Memory Pressure Handling**: Efficient queue management to prevent accumulation

#### 6. Advanced Features

- **Queue Status Monitoring**: `queueStatus` property for monitoring system state
- **Queue Clearing**: `clearQueue()` method for manual queue management
- **Rapid Request Handling**: Graceful handling of successive toast requests
- **Timer State Queries**: Methods to check timer pause state and remaining time

### Implementation Details

#### Enhanced TimerState Structure

```swift
/// Represents the state of a toast's auto-dismiss timer
private struct TimerState {
    let timer: Timer
    let startTime: Date
    let originalDuration: TimeInterval
    var isPaused: Bool = false
    var pausedAt: Date?

    /// Calculate remaining time accounting for paused duration
    var remainingTime: TimeInterval {
        let now = Date()
        if isPaused, let pausedAt = pausedAt {
            let elapsedTime = startTime.distance(to: pausedAt)
            return max(0, originalDuration - elapsedTime)
        } else {
            let elapsedTime = startTime.distance(to: now)
            return max(0, originalDuration - elapsedTime)
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

- Immutable timer reference for better safety
- Precise remaining time calculation with pause state handling
- Comprehensive documentation and clear logic flow
- Robust edge case handling with `max(0, ...)` protection

#### Advanced Queue Management System

```swift
/// Dictionary to track active timer states for auto-dismiss functionality
private var timerStates: [UUID: TimerState] = [:]

/// Queue for managing rapid successive toast requests
private var toastQueue: [ToastMessage] = []

/// Maximum number of toasts to display simultaneously
private let maxSimultaneousToasts: Int = 5

/// Minimum time between processing queued toasts (prevents spam)
private let queueProcessingInterval: TimeInterval = 0.1

/// Timer for processing queued toasts
private var queueProcessingTimer: Timer?

/// Serial queue for thread-safe operations
private let operationQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.tools.toastmanager", qos: .userInitiated)
```

**Enhanced Features:**

- **Timer State Dictionary**: Replaced simple timer tracking with comprehensive state management
- **Intelligent Queue**: FIFO queue with automatic processing for smooth user experience
- **Anti-Spam Protection**: Configurable processing interval prevents UI flooding
- **Thread Safety**: Dedicated serial queue ensures data consistency
- **Performance Optimization**: `.userInitiated` QoS for responsive toast operations

#### Enhanced Methods

- `processToastRequest()`: Handles display vs queue logic
- `displayToast()`: Immediate toast display
- `startQueueProcessing()` / `stopQueueProcessing()`: Queue management
- `processQueue()`: Processes queued toasts when space available
- `getRemainingTime()` / `isTimerPaused()`: Timer state queries

### Integration Updates

#### ToastView Integration

- Updated to use `@Environment(ToastManager.self)` for direct access
- Simplified hover handling with direct ToastManager calls
- Enhanced accessibility with real-time timer state information

#### ToastContainer Integration

- Updated pause/resume methods to use new timer state queries
- Improved accessibility actions with proper state checking

### Architecture Improvements

#### 1. From Simple Timers to Advanced State Management

- **Previous**: Basic `[UUID: Timer]` dictionary
- **Current**: Sophisticated `TimerState` structure with pause/resume capabilities
- **Benefits**: Accurate time tracking, better user control, enhanced reliability

#### 2. Intelligent Queue Processing

- **Implementation**: FIFO queue with automatic background processing
- **Anti-Spam**: Minimum processing intervals prevent UI overload
- **Capacity Management**: Configurable simultaneous toast limits
- **User Experience**: Seamless handling of rapid successive requests

#### 3. Comprehensive Thread Safety

- **Serial Queue**: All operations serialized for consistency
- **Race Condition Prevention**: Protected shared state access
- **Performance**: `.userInitiated` QoS for responsive operations
- **Reliability**: Atomic operations for critical sections

### Requirements Fulfilled
